## What is this?

This monstrosity bridges a USB 3G modem to [internet relay chat (IRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat),
allowing **one** user to send and receive SMS messages via the bridge. Using it requires running your own IRC daemon
(or having a friendly IRC daemon somewhere that lets you make large numbers of connections from one IP address).

This is also the spiritual successor of [matrix-appservice-sms](https://github.com/eeeeeta/matrix-appservice-sms/),
in that it does the same thing as matrix-appservice-sms, except way more reliably and for a different protocol.

## How do I set it up?

Documentation is currently being worked on, and will be available soon! For now, though, this project
is still in a pre-alpha phase.
